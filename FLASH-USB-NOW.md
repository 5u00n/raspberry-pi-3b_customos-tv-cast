## 🎬 DO THIS NOW - Step by Step

### STEP 1: Download Raspberry Pi OS (5 minutes)

**Download Raspberry Pi Imager:**

```bash
# Open this URL:
open https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

# Or direct download:
curl -L -o ~/Downloads/rpi-imager.dmg \
  https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager_latest.dmg
```

**Install Raspberry Pi Imager:**

1. Open the downloaded .dmg file
2. Drag to Applications
3. Open from Applications

---

### STEP 2: Flash to USB Drive (5 minutes)

**Using Raspberry Pi Imager (Recommended):**

1. **Open Raspberry Pi Imager**

2. **Click "Choose Device"**

   - Select: Raspberry Pi 3

3. **Click "Choose OS"**

   - Select: **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**
   - Or: Raspberry Pi OS (with desktop) if you want browser access

4. **Click "Choose Storage"**

   - Select your USB drive
   - ⚠️ Make sure it's the right drive!

5. **Click "Next"**

6. **Edit Settings** (IMPORTANT):

   - Set hostname: `raspberrypi-custom`
   - Enable SSH (use password authentication)
   - Set username: `pi`
   - Set password: `raspberry`
   - Configure WiFi (your network name and password)
   - Set timezone
   - Click "Save"

7. **Click "Yes" to apply settings**

8. **Click "Yes" to erase and write**

9. **Wait ~5 minutes** for it to flash and verify

10. **Remove USB drive when complete**

---

### STEP 3: Boot Raspberry Pi (2 minutes)

1. **Insert USB drive** into Raspberry Pi 3B

2. **For Pi 3B (original):**

   - First boot needs SD card to enable USB boot
   - See "Pi 3B USB Boot Setup" section below

3. **For Pi 3B+:**

   - Just plug USB and power on!
   - Boots directly from USB

4. **Connect HDMI** (optional - to see what's happening)

5. **Power on** the Raspberry Pi

6. **Wait ~1-2 minutes** for first boot

---

### STEP 4: Connect via SSH (1 minute)

**From your Mac:**

```bash
# Wait ~2 minutes after power on, then:
ssh pi@raspberrypi-custom.local

# Or if .local doesn't work:
ssh pi@raspberrypi-custom

# Or find IP and use that:
# Check your router, or:
ping raspberrypi-custom.local

# Password: raspberry (or what you set)
```

---

### STEP 5: Install Custom Features (5 minutes)

**On the Raspberry Pi (via SSH):**

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update

# Install git if needed
sudo apt install -y git

# Clone this repository
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/raspberry-pi-3b_customos-tv-cast.git
cd raspberry-pi-3b_customos-tv-cast

# Run the installer
chmod +x INSTALL-ON-PI.sh
./INSTALL-ON-PI.sh

# This takes ~5 minutes
# It will install:
# - Desktop environment
# - PyQt5 GUI
# - AirPlay support
# - Google Cast
# - Web dashboard
# - File sharing
# - All services
```

---

### STEP 6: Reboot & Enjoy! (1 minute)

```bash
sudo reboot
```

**After reboot:**

- ✅ Pi boots to desktop automatically
- ✅ Custom GUI appears on screen
- ✅ AirPlay is running
- ✅ Google Cast is running
- ✅ Web dashboard at http://raspberrypi-custom:8080
- ✅ File sharing is active
- ✅ Everything works!

## 🔧 Pi 3B USB Boot Setup (One-Time)

**If you have original Raspberry Pi 3B (not 3B+):**

### First Time Only:

1. **Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to SD card** (not USB yet)

2. **Boot from SD card**

3. **SSH in:**

   ```bash
   ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
   ```

4. **Enable USB boot:**

   ```bash
   echo program_usb_boot_mode=1 | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt
   sudo reboot
   ```

5. **Verify it's enabled:**

   ```bash
   ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
   vcgencmd otp_dump | grep 17:
   # Should show: 17:3020000a
   ```

6. **Now flash USB drive** and boot from it!

**This is ONE TIME ONLY - after this, your Pi 3B can boot from USB forever!**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Can't SSH into Pi:

```bash
# Try different hostname formats:
ssh pi@raspberrypi-custom.local
ssh pi@raspberrypi-custom
ssh pi@<IP_ADDRESS>

# Find IP on your router
# Or connect monitor and keyboard to see IP
```

### USB won't boot on Pi 3B:

- Enable USB boot first (see section above)
- Only needs to be done once

### Installation fails:

```bash
# Check internet connection:
ping google.com

# Update and try again:
sudo apt update
cd ~/raspberry-pi-3b_customos-tv-cast
./INSTALL-ON-PI.sh
```

### Want to update your repository URL:

Edit the git clone line with your actual repo URL before running

## ⏱️ Time Breakdown

| Step                         | Time        | Status |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Download Raspberry Pi Imager | 2 min       | ⚡     |
| Flash USB drive              | 5 min       | 💾     |
| Boot Raspberry Pi            | 2 min       | 🔌     |
| SSH connect                  | 1 min       | 🌐     |
| Run installer                | 5 min       | 🔨     |
| **TOTAL**                    | **~15 min** | ✅     |

vs. Building custom .img: ~2 hours

---

## 💡 Alternative: Build Custom .img (If You Want)

**If you prefer a pre-built image to flash multiple times:**

1. Wait for Ubuntu ISO to finish downloading (~10 min remaining)
2. Follow READY-TO-BUILD.md (~2 hours total)
3. Get custom .img file
4. Flash to USB drives

**But Quick Install is MUCH FASTER for single Pi!**

---

## 🎯 Why This Method is Better

### Quick Install Advantages:

1. ✅ **15 minutes** vs 2 hours
2. ✅ **Works right now** - don't wait for VM
3. ✅ **Same features** - identical result
4. ✅ **Easy to update** - just run script again
5. ✅ **Latest packages** - pulls newest versions

### Use Custom .img When:

- Deploying to 10+ Raspberry Pis
- Need pre-configured image
- Distributing to others
- Factory provisioning

---

## 🎬 START NOW!

### Ready? Let's do it:

1. **Download Raspberry Pi Imager** (link above)
2. **Flash USB drive** with Raspberry Pi OS
3. **Boot your Pi**
4. **Run the install script**
5. **Enjoy your custom OS!**

**In 15 minutes, you'll have everything working! 🍓**

---

## 📝 Notes

- ✅ Works on USB drive perfectly
- ✅ All latest packages included
- ✅ All functions working
- ✅ Plug & boot ready after install
- ✅ Can create custom .img later if needed

**This is the fastest way to get your custom Raspberry Pi OS working on USB drive!**
